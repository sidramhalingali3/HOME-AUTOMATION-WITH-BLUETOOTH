*DESCRIPTION OF TASK*:The Home Automation System using Bluetooth is a smart embedded project that enables users to wirelessly control home appliances such as lights, fans, and other devices using a smartphone or Bluetooth-enabled controller. It utilizes a microcontroller like Arduino Uno or ESP32, paired with a Bluetooth module such as HC-05 or HC-06, to receive commands sent from a mobile app or terminal. Upon receiving these commands, the microcontroller processes the input and triggers the appropriate output devices connected via relays or transistors. The system is programmed using platforms like the Arduino IDE, and communication is established through standard Bluetooth serial protocols. This project is highly applicable in smart home systems where convenience, energy efficiency, and remote control are important. It allows users to automate routine tasks, improve accessibility for the elderly or physically challenged, and add modern functionality to traditional appliances. The project provides a strong foundation in wireless communication, embedded system design, and real-time device control. Additionally, it can be enhanced by integrating sensors, voice control, or IoT features. This makes it an ideal project to include on GitHub, showcasing skills in Bluetooth interfacing, mobile communication, and automation technology.
